# Rails Playground
## About
This project is not meant to do anything useful.  If it does its by pure coincidence and you should not expect it to keep doing it.

I built this just while experimenting with RoR

## Install

###### Cloud9
If you create a cloud9 machine it should run straight away after doing the usual steps...

1. bin/bundle Install
2. rake db:create
3. rake db:migrate
4. rake db:seed
5. rails server

###### Windows Subsystem for Linux / Bash on Ubuntu on Windows
I followed the instructions on this [link](http://daverupert.com/2016/06/ruby-on-rails-on-bash-on-ubuntu-on-windows/) to get rails 2.3 under Windows, then I ran

    # sudo bin/rails setup

###### Other
I'll add more as I try them out.
